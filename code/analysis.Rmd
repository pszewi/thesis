# Description
In this file I will be writing down the methodological notes for my thesis and I will also compute here my experiment. 



## Experiment-setup:
I am trying to investigate whether firms can utilize greenwashing as a profitable strategy. In order to do that I want to create a measure of greenwashing by following *(Lagasio, 2024)*. Furthermore, I will utilize a natural experiment (DiD) to search for causality.


## Experiment notes:
* Use a DiD with continuous treatment to see whether greenwashing more makes you profit more
* For applying treatment, use the level of greenwashing from 2017/2018
    * The justification is that I need to assume that the treatment level was constant which implies that I should have as little time as possible between the treatment assignment and my shock 
    * I have computed both the 2017 and the 2018 Greenwashing index.
* For the shock, use September 2019, as that's when there was a lot of buzz around another IPCC report and Fridays For Future movement
    * use cumulative abnormal returns as the outcome variable 
    * use sales as a secondary outcome variable

Some pictures showing google trends around specific queries around that time:

# Code

## Loading libraries

```{r, libs, message = FALSE}
library(httpgd)
library(tidyverse)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)

```

## Loading Data

First loading here data at the weekly frequency as it seems the most reasonable.


```{r,data, message = FALSE}

data_abnormal_returns_w <- read_csv("data/output/data_abnormal_returns_w.csv")
company_characteristics <- read_csv("data/output/company_characteristics.csv")
greenwashing_ind  <- read_csv("data/text_processing/greenwashing_ind_2017.csv")

```

```{r, head}

greenwashing_ind  %>% head()

```

Testing ggplot
```{r}

ggplot() + geom_line(data = data_abnormal_returns_w[1:6, ],
                     aes(x = DATE, y = STOCK_LOG_RETURN,
                         group = NAME))


```
