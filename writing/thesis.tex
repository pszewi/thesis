\section{Introduction}\label{sect:introduction}

In recent years, climate change has become an issue of a global importance. Policymakers, international 
organizations as well as consumers have been growing more aware of the problems facing the world in the upcoming years. In turn, heightened awareness has led to more and more people becoming educated on the topic of sustainability and climate change prevention. This awareness has lead to a rapid development of sustainable finance and a creation of a large body of ESG investment funds. Companies, trying to answer the needs of consumers have reoriented their supply chains and started transitioning to more sustainable methods of production. At the same time, this structural shift in demand created an avenue for greenwashing. In this setting, some companies can choose to appear as sustainable through making statements or campaigns aimed at sustainable consumers/investors, while not carrying through with their promises. Recent theoretical literature suggests that there exist equilibria where it is optimal for companies to greenwash~\parencite{wu_bad_2020, cartellierCanInvestorsCurb2023}, as the investments in sustainability are largely unobserved. In sectors with large costs of the transition, this could potentially allow them to benefit from this shift in demand, while not bearing the costs. 

This paper tries to answer the question: Is greenwashing a beneficial strategy for company performance in the presence of a positive sustainability demand shock? My approach consists of two steps.

Firstly, I collect and process the sustainability reports for a sample of public companies, for which such reports are available. After processing, the reports are used to create a Cheap-Talk-Index (CTI) that gauges the credibility of climate commitments made by companies \parencite{bingler_how_2024}. This index allows for measuring the likelihood of greenwashing following the contributions of~\cite{coen_are_2022}.

Secondly, I try to estimate a causal response of cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) of companies stock prices' to greenwashing in presence of a demand shock to sustainability. Using the release of the 2019 International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report titled ``Special Report on Climate Change and Land'' (8 August 2019) and the occurrence of the ``Global Week for Future'', a series of 4500 strikes across over 150 countries on the last two Fridays of September 2019, as the shock and the CTI as the treatment, I test whether the markets have responded to differently to firms more likely to greenwash. I find that the shock did not significantly impact the CAR of companies more likely to greenwash. The CAR showed no economically significant difference over the specified period.\ \textbf{This result can be explained by assumptions or by some other mechanism}.

Finally, I use the same procedure to investigate the effects on sales of the abovementioned companies. I argue that companies trying to be perceived among investors as environmentally friendly, are likely to try to be perceived in the same way by their customers. Using the CTI, I test whether the sales of greenwashing companies have been substantially impacted following the shock. Results indicate that their clients did not change their approach to consumption following the summer of 2019.\ \textbf{This result can be explained by assumptions or by some other mechanism}. 
 

This study is related to the \textbf{X} streams of literature. First, it contributes to the literature on market reactions to greenwashing, by showing how the market has re-priced the value of the greenwashing firms in the presence of a shock.  

Secondly it draws on the literature concerning the relation between principals and managers, by checking whether the market is able to see through the greenwashing of firms. Studies concerning themselves with the impact of company environmental performance and its effects on the financial performance are many.~\cite{ilhan_climate_2023}, suggests that 

Finally, it contributes to literature on the link between advertising and consumer behaviour, by investigating the effects of greenwashing on the reactions of consumers. 


\section{Background}\label{sect:background}

The year 2019 was an important year for climate change awareness as well as for climate change policy. Over the course of the year, popularity of the climate strikes had been rising, with the peak reaching reported over 4 million of people taking part in them across many countries in October 2019. Moreover, this year has been impacted by many droughts, hottest days and climactic events. In August 2019 the special IPCC report has been released talking about the impact of Climate Change on land use and land changes. 


% argue how the release of IPCC IS DIFFERENT FROM THE STRIKES BECAUSE THEY ARE AN ACTION FROM INDIVIDUALS AND NOT JUST A STATEMENT FROM SCIENTIST

As evidenced by the Figure~\ref{fig:news_trends}, climate change both have been gaining importance in the minds of the public in the past few years. While the overall number of new articles created by the New York Times has been in decline from 2012 until 2019, authors have been writing more articles revolving around climate change. Sustainability and Environment have also been more pronounced, however their temporary rise may be associated with the fac that more articles were written in general in 2020.

\section{Data}\label{sect:data}

The data collected for the thesis comes from multiple sources. The ESG reports were scraped from the \href{https://responsibilityreports.com}{ResponsibilityReports.com}. The company characteristics, their stock price returns as well as their quarterly earnings have been extracted from the Refinitiv database. Furthermore, a measure of abnormal returns and a greenwashing indicator were constructed.


\subsection{Scraping}

Scraping the \href{https://responsibilityreports.com}{ResponsibilityReports.com} website allowed me to collect company reports relating to ESG and CSR\@. Additionally, it also allowed me to retrieve information on company headquarters location and the approximate number of employees. Table\ref{tab:sust_reps} displays the number of reports available per year. As can be seen, the number of reports is non-homogenous across the years, as with time, communicating sustainability has become more important. 
    
% More text follows here. Generally the next step is to describe what the sustainability reports contain and why are they useful, why I haven't chosen them instead of something else, how they relate to my outcome variables.
    
\subsection{Greenwashing Indicator}

Sustainability reports contain information meant for investors and stakeholders. They inform the reader on initiatives undertaken by the company to manage its impact on the environment, its production standards, as well as the climate risk a company is exposed to. To illustrate, \citeauthor{3m2018sustainability}'s 2018 Sustainability Report titled ``Improving Lives'' contains the following sections:  ``Our Values, Vision, and 
Strategies'', ``Enterprise Risk'', ``Environmental Management'' (non-exhaustive). 

As these reports do not fall under the oversight of any institutions (unlike annual earnings reports), the companies issuing them, may overstate their environmental achievements and as such use them to appeal to investors/consumers rather than present unbiased information. This implies the possibility of greenwashing and deception introduced by companies, to manipulate the perception of stakeholders without bearing the cost. 

To identify this phenomenon in relation to the environmental claims, the text was extracted from the reports. This has been done by using blocks contained in the PDF files to keep individual paragraphs separate.\ \textbf{Note: emphasize that only text was extracted, can't analyse tables}. To further refine the data, each block has been classified as a paragraph, if it spanned at least 3 lines, contained at least 30 words and had at least one full stop. This has been done following the rule-based approach of \parencite{bingler_how_2024}. 

Then, again following the approach of \citeauthor{bingler_how_2024}, the Climate Cheap-Talk Indicator ($CTI$) was constructed.\ \textbf{NOTE:\@ BRIEFLY DESCRIBE THE INS AND OUTS OF THE MODEL HERE.} This has been done in two steps. Firstly, a version of the \texttt{ClimateBert}$_{CTI}$ model fine-tuned for classifying paragraphs was used to determine whether a given paragraph is climate related or not. Then, another version of the \texttt{ClimateBert}$_{CTI}$ model, fine-tuned for classifying paragraphs as specific (containing specific commitments) and non-specific (containing only vague commitments) was used to determine the specificity of each paragraph in each document. Then, finally, the $CTI$ was constructed by using the formula:


\begin{equation}
    CTI = \frac{CLIM_i \cap NONSPEC_i}{CLIM_{i}}
\end{equation}

Where for a sustainability report of company $i$, $CLIM_i$ represents the number of climate-related paragraphs, $NONSPEC_i$ represents the number of paragraphs containing specific commitments, and $CLIM_i \cap NONSPEC_i$ represents the intersection between the two. 
This approach is motivated by the work of\ \cite{coen_are_2022}, which finds that companies are less likely to follow-up on their commitments if these are stated in a vague and non-specific manner. Therefore, the $CTI$, interpreted as a measure of non-specificity of companies climate commitments, is used as a proxy for greenwashing.\ \textbf{NOTE:\@ DESCRIBE THE LIMITATIONS OF THE APPROACH HERE --- NO WAY TO CONCRETELY DETERMINE GREENWASHING}

% \subsubsection{Robustness}

% I think I should retrieve (somehow) and analyze the ESG ratings of the companies that I use to have an alternative description/robustness check on this issue (or at least ned to argue why ESG ratings are not reliable if I'm not including them/could also include this in the limitations)


\subsection{Refinitiv}

The Refinitiv dataset has been used to retrieve data on firms' characteristics, their price indices, quarterly earnings. Additionally, the regional indices (\textit{explain better, values for index funds/stock indices, i.e.\@ S\&P and stuff}) were retrieved in order to estimate the normal returns of each company. The characteristic variables include the stock exchange of the listing, country of incorporation, country of domicile, the company's sector and the company's industry. The price indices (defined as the value of the stock as a fraction of the initial listing price), were log-differenced to transform them into percentage changes. The same has been done for the quarterly earnings and for the values of regional stock indices.\ \textbf{Talk about how many periods retrieved for estimation of normal returns and for event window!!}.

\subsection{Abnormal Returns}

In order to plausibly estimate the effect of the treatment on stock returns, I needed to separate the effects of the market movement from the movement of the stock of the company itself. These abnormal returns were estimated following the market model approach outlined in\ \cite{mackinlayEventStudiesEconomics1997}. This approach relies on estimating the expected stock return by predicting it using the return of the whole market. As the sample contains companies from multiple continents which markets may differ, multiple stock indices were used. The companies were allocated to a geographical market index by their country of domicile. The allocation can be viewed in Table~\ref{tab:mrkt_ind} in the Appendix~\ref{app:data}. The model has been separately estimated for each company using observations that predate the estimation window of interest. Intervals used for estimation of data at each frequency is reported in Table~\ref{tab:data_freq}. Below I report the regression specification used for the estimation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:reg_market_model}
    RN_{it} = \alpha_i + \beta_{i} RI_{mt} + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{equation}

Where, $RN_{it}$ is the return of the security $i$ at time $t$ predicted by the return of its geographical market $m$, where $RI_{mt}$ is the return of the said market. Finally, as this regression estimates the return of the security predicted by the return of the market, the abnormal return for $i$ in a given time period $t$ is given by the residual $\varepsilon_{it}$.

This type of modelling is sufficient for my use case, as per the work of~\citeauthor{mackinlayEventStudiesEconomics1997}, employing more sophisticated models (e.g.~factor models) yields limited improvement in studies that do not rely on within-group variation, such as within-sector variation.

Moreover, the abnormal returns for each of the securities were later cumulatively summed to arrive at the Cumulative Abnormal Return (CAR). This was done, as aggregation across time is needed in order to draw useful inference from the results of the actual study (\textbf{Maybe describe in more detail --- if you're estimating the DiD on AR then it's meaningless}). 

\subsection{Merging}

The data on greenwashing has been merged with the stock indices. This has been a difficult process, as company names are often reported differently between different services. Multiple strategies were used to merge the data. Firstly, the data was merged on the names retrieved from the \href{https://responsibilityreports.com}{ResponsibilityReports.com} and the longest version of names available in the Refinitiv database.\@ \textbf{This resulted in \dots\ observations}. After that, the datasets were merged on the stock tickers conditional on being listed on the same exchange.\@ \textbf{This resulted in \dots\ observations}. Finally, the \dots\ (remaining strategy).\ \textbf{Unfortunately this has left \dots\ observations missing}. However, this can be safely assumed away, as only \dots\ companies were missing out of the \dots\ companies that posted the 2018, which will be used for analysis. Therefore, the resulting dataset has \dots\ companies.

\section{Methodology}\label{sect:methodology}

This section describes the methodology used in the attempt to estimate the causal effect of greenwashing on company performance.
My initial approach was to use a classic Difference-in-Differences (DiD) methodology with multiple periods, however upon consideration I decided to implement a variation of DiD with multivalued treatments following \parencite{callawayDifferenceindifferencesContinuousTreatment2024}. This approach is motivated by the fact, that the market may react differently to firms that use more cheap talk in their communication. 

Given the use of newly developed methods in this study, I chose to contrast their methodology with the well-understood traditional DiD framework to better illustrate how this approach can improve upon the default approach. Therefore, the methodology is divided into three parts. Firstly, I will cover the conventional difference-in-differences design. Then I will contrast it with the implemented design using multivalued treatment. Finally, I will describe the differences in the taken approach when estimating the effect on sales of companies instead of stock prices.


\subsection{Default Difference-in-Differences}

Conventional Difference-in-Differences studies try to elicit the causal effect of a policy by the units across time and then to each other (\textbf{reword this nicely}). In order to separate the causal effect, they require two main assumptions explained below\footnote{A formal treatment of these assumptions can be found in Appendix~\ref{app:models:assumptions}}. 

\textbf{Parallel trends (PT) assumption}, which requires that in the absence of treatment, the outcomes of the units assigned to the treatment group would have evolved in the same way (in terms of the trend) as the outcomes of the units that were not assigned to treatment. In my example, it implies that in the absence of cheap-talk of a company (i.e.\ greenwashing), their stock price/sales would have evolved similarly to those that do not engage in cheap talk currently. 

\textbf{No anticipation assumption}, imposes that the individuals do not anticipate the treatment. In my example, it implies that the market does not anticipate the outcome of the IPCC report conference and therefore the investors do not act on their expectation in advance of the event.\ \textit{In other words, you being treated does not matter for the outcome in advance of the treatment --- think whether this could be rewritten this way.}

Under these two assumptions and an additional assumption on independent sampling, the treatment effect can be recovered using the following regression specification utilizing two-way-fixed-effects (TWFE):

\begin{equation}
    Y_{i,t} = \alpha_i + \Phi_t + \beta^{twfe} D_{i} \cdot Post_{t} + \varepsilon_{i,t}
\end{equation}

Where $Y_{it}$ is the outcome variable, $\alpha_i$ is the entity fixed effect, $\Phi_t$ is the time fixed effect, $D_i$ is the treatment dummy, $Post_t$ is the period dummy and $\beta^{twfe}$ recovers the causal effect. 

Although the interpretation of this treatment effect has been well described, it is not useful when analysing cases with multiple treatment doses \parencite{callawayDifferenceindifferencesContinuousTreatment2024} Therefore, in the following section I describe the methodology of an adjusted framework.

\subsection{Formal assumptions}\label{app:models:assumptions}
In order to formally describe the assumptions, I adopt the potential outcomes framework of~\cite{rubinEstimatingCausalEffects1974}

\subsubsection{Parallel Trends (PT)}

Formally it is given by: 
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}[Y_{i,2}(0) - Y_{i,1}(0) | D_i = 1] = \mathbb{E}[Y_{i,2}(0) - Y_{i,1}(0) | D_i = 0]
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{No anticipation}
Formally, the assumption is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    Y_{i,1}(0) = Y_{i,1}(1) \text{ for all } i \text{ with } D_i = 1
\end{equation}
